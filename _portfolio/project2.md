Nothing is more fun for me than sharing what I love with other people. Beyond my research, I spent 7 years leading nightly astronomy programs as the 'Dark Ranger' at Mount Rainier National Park, and then transitioned to Denali National Park to focus more on geology programs and experiential learning by leading visitors on all-day, off-trail "Discovery Hikes" in the tundra. I can promise you, it's the coolest type of ranger program in the NPS!

I've spent the better part of a decade developing the skills to communicate with every type of audience, and I've been featured in a number of places for my expertise and enthusiasm. Check out some of my work:
