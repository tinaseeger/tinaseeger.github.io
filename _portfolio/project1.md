Jupiter's moon Io is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System, with nearly constant volcanic eruptions.  For good reason, most research on Io is focused on the volcanoes.  I am more fascinated by the mountains---tectonic behemoths that would dwarf Mount Everest---and even spent my Senior year of college writing a thesis about their wide range of morphologies.

I am currently using brand new imagery from the Juno spacecraft flying around Jupiter *right now* to take a fresh look at erosion mechanisms on Io and how some of these massive mountains are breaking down over time.

I've also done some modeling of the tidal stresses acting on the surface of Io--tides in the rock caused by the fight between Jupiter's gravity and the pull of the moons Europa and Ganymede further out--in order to evaluate whether these tides have an impact on how mountains and volcanoes actually form on the surface.
