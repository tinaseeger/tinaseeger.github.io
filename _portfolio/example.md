My work focuses on the way the sedimentary rocks of Mars record the history of ancient water on this now-dry planet.  I primarily work with the Curiosity rover, which just celebrated 12 years of Martian exploration, and use the close-up images it takes of the surface to study how the rock is cemented together.  

Groundwater likely flowed through pore spaces in these rocks long after the lakes and rivers dried up on the surface, and I am using unique diagenetic textures--color splotches, raised bumpy nodules, and veins that all formed as a result of this groundwater movement--to better understand the timing and extent of Mars' drying process.

You can read all about it in my paper, coming out soon!
